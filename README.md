# css
index.css
just a file I've been working on to avoid using something like bootstrap

it has a bunch of stuff I use and I'll keep making updates as I find more stuff I use
has a reset, sets some basic margins on h# and p tags,
has a color palette and dark mode palette

has css only dropdown and css only mobile nav

remove increment buttons from number input
thin scrollbars in firefox and chrome

loader animation
